# Explanation:
# Write-Host prompts the user for input and displays the message.
# Read-Host stores the user's input in the corresponding variable ($dirPath and $minSizeMB).
# Read-Host -AsInt converts the user's input for minimum size to an integer.
# $minSizeBytes calculates the minimum size in bytes by multiplying the user-provided MB value by 1MB.
# The rest of the script remains the same as before, using the user-provided directory path and minimum size.
