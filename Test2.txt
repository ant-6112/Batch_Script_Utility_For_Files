ant-6112: Write a Powershell Script that Scans a for Files greater than 10 MB.

GitHub Copilot: Here's a PowerShell script that scans a directory for files greater than 10 MB. Replace `"C:\path\to\directory"` with the path to the directory you want to scan.

```powershell
# Define the path to the directory
$directoryPath = "C:\path\to\directory"

# Get all files in the directory and its subdirectories
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $directoryPath -Recurse -File

# Filter the files to only include those larger than 10 MB
$largeFiles = $files | Where-Object { $_.Length -gt 10MB }

# Output the large files
$largeFiles | ForEach-Object {
    Write-Output ("File: " + $_.FullName + ", Size: " + $_.Length/1MB + " MB")
}
```

This script uses the `Get-ChildItem` cmdlet to get all files in the specified directory and its subdirectories. It then uses the `Where-Object` cmdlet to filter the files to only include those larger than 10 MB. Finally, it outputs the large files with their full path and size in MB.

ant-6112: Write the Users who last modified the file too.

GitHub Copilot: To include the user who last modified the file, you can use the `.GetAccessControl().Owner` property of the file object. Here's the updated script:

```powershell
# Define the path to the directory
$directoryPath = "C:\path\to\directory"

# Get all files in the directory and its subdirectories
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $directoryPath -Recurse -File

# Filter the files to only include those larger than 10 MB
$largeFiles = $files | Where-Object { $_.Length -gt 10MB }

# Output the large files
$largeFiles | ForEach-Object {
    $owner = (Get-Acl $_.FullName).Owner
    Write-Output ("File: " + $_.FullName + ", Size: " + $_.Length/1MB + " MB, Last Modified By: " + $owner)
}
```

This script uses the `Get-Acl` cmdlet to get the Access Control List (ACL) for each file, which includes the owner of the file. The owner is typically the user who last modified the file.

ant-6112: Now get the Users who are using the most storage based on this

GitHub Copilot: To get the users who are using the most storage, you can group the files by owner and sum the sizes of the files for each owner. Here's the updated script:

```powershell
# Define the path to the directory
$directoryPath = "C:\path\to\directory"

# Get all files in the directory and its subdirectories
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $directoryPath -Recurse -File

# Filter the files to only include those larger than 10 MB
$largeFiles = $files | Where-Object { $_.Length -gt 10MB }

# Group the files by owner and calculate the total size for each owner
$storageByUser = $largeFiles | ForEach-Object {
    $owner = (Get-Acl $_.FullName).Owner
    New-Object PSObject -Property @{
        Owner = $owner
        Size = $_.Length
    }
} | Group-Object -Property Owner | ForEach-Object {
    New-Object PSObject -Property @{
        Owner = $_.Name
        TotalSize = ($_.Group | Measure-Object -Property Size -Sum).Sum / 1MB
    }
}

# Sort the users by total size in descending order and output the result
$storageByUser | Sort-Object -Property TotalSize -Descending | ForEach-Object {
    Write-Output ("User: " + $_.Owner + ", Total Size: " + $_.TotalSize + " MB")
}
```

This script creates a new object for each file with the owner and size of the file. It then groups these objects by owner and calculates the total size for each group. Finally, it sorts the users by total size in descending order and outputs the result.

ant-6112: Export 2 Excel Sheets
- One Telling the Largest Files by Size, Owner, Size
- Other Telling the Users using the Most Storage in Descending Order

GitHub Copilot: To export data to Excel, you can use the `Export-Excel` cmdlet from the `ImportExcel` PowerShell module. If you don't have this module installed, you can install it with `Install-Module -Name ImportExcel -Scope CurrentUser`.

Here's the updated script:

```powershell
# Install the ImportExcel module if not already installed
if (!(Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name ImportExcel)) {
    Install-Module -Name ImportExcel -Scope CurrentUser -Force
}

# Define the path to the directory
$directoryPath = "C:\path\to\directory"

# Get all files in the directory and its subdirectories
$files = Get-ChildItem -Path $directoryPath -Recurse -File

# Filter the files to only include those larger than 10 MB
$largeFiles = $files | Where-Object { $_.Length -gt 10MB } | ForEach-Object {
    $owner = (Get-Acl $_.FullName).Owner
    New-Object PSObject -Property @{
        File = $_.FullName
        Size = $_.Length / 1MB
        Owner = $owner
    }
}

# Export the large files to an Excel sheet
$largeFiles | Export-Excel -Path "LargeFiles.xlsx" -WorksheetName "Large Files" -AutoSize

# Group the files by owner and calculate the total size for each owner
$storageByUser = $largeFiles | Group-Object -Property Owner | ForEach-Object {
    New-Object PSObject -Property @{
        Owner = $_.Name
        TotalSize = ($_.Group | Measure-Object -Property Size -Sum).Sum
    }
} | Sort-Object -Property TotalSize -Descending

# Export the storage by user to another Excel sheet
$storageByUser | Export-Excel -Path "StorageByUser.xlsx" -WorksheetName "Storage By User" -AutoSize
```

This script exports the large files to an Excel sheet named "Large Files" in a file named "LargeFiles.xlsx", and the storage by user to another Excel sheet named "Storage By User" in a file named "StorageByUser.xlsx". The `-AutoSize` parameter is used to automatically adjust the column widths to fit the data.

ant-6112: can you write the code as a noob coder like splitting code more and stuff like that

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's the same script broken down into smaller steps with more comments:

```powershell
# Import the necessary module for Excel export
if (!(Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name ImportExcel)) {
    Install-Module -Name ImportExcel -Scope CurrentUser -Force
}

# Define the path to the directory
$directoryPath = "C:\path\to\directory"

# Get all files in the directory and its subdirectories
$allFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $directoryPath -Recurse -File

# Initialize an empty array to store large files
$largeFiles = @()

# Loop through all files
foreach ($file in $allFiles) {
    # Check if the file size is greater than 10 MB
    if ($file.Length -gt 10MB) {
        # Get the owner of the file
        $owner = (Get-Acl $file.FullName).Owner

        # Create a new object with file details
        $fileDetails = New-Object PSObject -Property @{
            File = $file.FullName
            Size = $file.Length / 1MB
            Owner = $owner
        }

        # Add the file details to the large files array
        $largeFiles += $fileDetails
    }
}

# Export the large files to an Excel sheet
$largeFiles | Export-Excel -Path "LargeFiles.xlsx" -WorksheetName "Large Files" -AutoSize

# Initialize an empty array to store user storage details
$userStorageDetails = @()

# Group the large files by owner
$groupedFiles = $largeFiles | Group-Object -Property Owner

# Loop through the grouped files
foreach ($group in $groupedFiles) {
    # Calculate the total size for the group
    $totalSize = ($group.Group | Measure-Object -Property Size -Sum).Sum

    # Create a new object with user storage details
    $storageDetails = New-Object PSObject -Property @{
        Owner = $group.Name
        TotalSize = $totalSize
    }

    # Add the storage details to the user storage details array
    $userStorageDetails += $storageDetails
}

# Sort the user storage details by total size in descending order
$sortedUserStorageDetails = $userStorageDetails | Sort-Object -Property TotalSize -Descending

# Export the user storage details to another Excel sheet
$sortedUserStorageDetails | Export-Excel -Path "StorageByUser.xlsx" -WorksheetName "Storage By User" -AutoSize
```

This script does the same thing as the previous one, but it uses more variables to store intermediate results and has more comments to explain each step.

ant-6112: Split it even more

GitHub Copilot: Sure, here's the script split into even smaller steps:

```powershell
# Import the necessary module for Excel export
if (!(Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name ImportExcel)) {
    Install-Module -Name ImportExcel -Scope CurrentUser -Force
}

# Define the path to the directory
$directoryPath = "C:\path\to\directory"

# Get all files in the directory and its subdirectories
$allFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $directoryPath -Recurse -File

# Initialize an empty array to store large files
$largeFiles = @()

# Loop through all files
foreach ($file in $allFiles) {
    # Check if the file size is greater than 10 MB
    if ($file.Length -gt 10MB) {
        # Get the owner of the file
        $acl = Get-Acl $file.FullName
        $owner = $acl.Owner

        # Calculate the size in MB
        $sizeInMB = $file.Length / 1MB

        # Create a new object with file details
        $fileDetails = New-Object PSObject -Property @{
            File = $file.FullName
            Size = $sizeInMB
            Owner = $owner
        }

        # Add the file details to the large files array
        $largeFiles += $fileDetails
    }
}

# Define the path to the Excel file for large files
$largeFilesExcelPath = "LargeFiles.xlsx"

# Export the large files to an Excel sheet
$largeFiles | Export-Excel -Path $largeFilesExcelPath -WorksheetName "Large Files" -AutoSize

# Initialize an empty array to store user storage details
$userStorageDetails = @()

# Group the large files by owner
$groupedFiles = $largeFiles | Group-Object -Property Owner

# Loop through the grouped files
foreach ($group in $groupedFiles) {
    # Calculate the total size for the group
    $sizes = $group.Group | Measure-Object -Property Size -Sum
    $totalSize = $sizes.Sum

    # Create a new object with user storage details
    $storageDetails = New-Object PSObject -Property @{
        Owner = $group.Name
        TotalSize = $totalSize
    }

    # Add the storage details to the user storage details array
    $userStorageDetails += $storageDetails
}

# Sort the user storage details by total size in descending order
$sortedUserStorageDetails = $userStorageDetails | Sort-Object -Property TotalSize -Descending

# Define the path to the Excel file for user storage details
$userStorageExcelPath = "StorageByUser.xlsx"

# Export the user storage details to another Excel sheet
$sortedUserStorageDetails | Export-Excel -Path $userStorageExcelPath -WorksheetName "Storage By User" -AutoSize
```

This script does the same thing as the previous one, but it uses even more variables to store intermediate results and has more comments to explain each step.

ant-6112: Both CSV are empty even though in while Debugging and printing in command line it is showing file sfound

GitHub Copilot: If the CSV files are empty but the data is showing correctly in the command line, it's possible that the `Export-Excel` cmdlet is not working as expected. 

As an alternative, you can use the `Export-Csv` cmdlet to export the data to CSV files, which can be opened with Excel. Here's the updated script:

```powershell
# Define the path to the directory
$directoryPath = "C:\path\to\directory"

# Get all files in the directory and its subdirectories
$allFiles = Get-ChildItem -Path $directoryPath -Recurse -File

# Initialize an empty array to store large files
$largeFiles = @()

# Loop through all files
foreach ($file in $allFiles) {
    # Check if the file size is greater than 10 MB
    if ($file.Length -gt 10MB) {
        # Get the owner of the file
        $acl = Get-Acl $file.FullName
        $owner = $acl.Owner

        # Calculate the size in MB
        $sizeInMB = $file.Length / 1MB

        # Create a new object with file details
        $fileDetails = New-Object PSObject -Property @{
            File = $file.FullName
            Size = $sizeInMB
            Owner = $owner
        }

        # Add the file details to the large files array
        $largeFiles += $fileDetails
    }
}

# Define the path to the CSV file for large files
$largeFilesCsvPath = "LargeFiles.csv"

# Export the large files to a CSV file
$largeFiles | Export-Csv -Path $largeFilesCsvPath -NoTypeInformation

# Initialize an empty array to store user storage details
$userStorageDetails = @()

# Group the large files by owner
$groupedFiles = $largeFiles | Group-Object -Property Owner

# Loop through the grouped files
foreach ($group in $groupedFiles) {
    # Calculate the total size for the group
    $sizes = $group.Group | Measure-Object -Property Size -Sum
    $totalSize = $sizes.Sum

    # Create a new object with user storage details
    $storageDetails = New-Object PSObject -Property @{
        Owner = $group.Name
        TotalSize = $totalSize
    }

    # Add the storage details to the user storage details array
    $userStorageDetails += $storageDetails
}

# Sort the user storage details by total size in descending order
$sortedUserStorageDetails = $userStorageDetails | Sort-Object -Property TotalSize -Descending

# Define the path to the CSV file for user storage details
$userStorageCsvPath = "StorageByUser.csv"

# Export the user storage details to another CSV file
$sortedUserStorageDetails | Export-Csv -Path $userStorageCsvPath -NoTypeInformation
```

This script exports the large files to a CSV file named "LargeFiles.csv", and the storage by user to another CSV file named "StorageByUser.csv". The `-NoTypeInformation` parameter is used to prevent the output of the type information to the CSV file.

ant-6112: how to write to host

GitHub Copilot: In PowerShell, you can use the `Write-Host` cmdlet to write customized output to a PowerShell host. Here's an example:

```powershell
# Define a variable
$myVariable = "Hello, world!"

# Write the variable to the host
Write-Host $myVariable
```

In this example, "Hello, world!" will be printed to the console.

You can also include variables in the string using the `-f` operator:

```powershell
# Define variables
$name = "John"
$age = 30

# Write a formatted string to the host
Write-Host ("My name is {0} and I am {1} years old." -f $name, $age)
```

In this example, "My name is John and I am 30 years old." will be printed to the console.
