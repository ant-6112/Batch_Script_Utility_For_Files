Here are some functionalities that could be added to enhance the script:

1. **Filter by File Type**: You could add functionality to filter the files by type. For example, you might want to only consider `.mp4` or `.jpg` files.

2. **Date Range**: You could add functionality to only consider files that were modified within a certain date range.

3. **User Input**: You could modify the script to take user input for the directory path and the size threshold.

4. **Error Handling**: You could add more robust error handling to the script. For example, you could handle the case where the specified directory does not exist.

5. **Logging**: You could add logging to the script to keep a record of what files were found and what actions were taken.

6. **Email Notifications**: You could add functionality to send an email notification with the Excel files attached when the script finishes running.

7. **Database Integration**: You could modify the script to store the file information in a database instead of (or in addition to) an Excel file.

8. **Scheduled Execution**: You could schedule the script to run at regular intervals using a task scheduler.

9. **Interactive Dashboard**: You could create an interactive dashboard with a graphical representation of the data, using tools like PowerBI or Tableau.

10. **Cloud Integration**: If the files are stored in a cloud storage service like AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage, you could modify the script to work with these services.
